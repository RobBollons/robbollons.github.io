### I'm Rob Bollons, I live in a small village in The Isle of Axholme in Lincolnshire with my amazing soon-to-be-wife and my gorgeous pet dog called Mya.

I work full time as Development Team Lead for an awesome company called Cascade Human Resources Ltd that produces enterprise HR software. I get some big challenges to deal with which is what makes the job great.

Hobbies wise, I like bouldering, camping and brewing my own beer. I also have a taste for Single Malt Scotch.

I've been in the web industry since 2007 and I like to think I've been lucky enough to have more experiences than most in that time ranging through the whole life cycle of little and large web applications covering many different roles.

#### My current topic of choice is Psychology surrounding the web industry including: working in a team, development processes, business and motivation. ####

If you see me at meet-ups, conferences or anywhere else, buy me a beer and I will gladly reciprocate with conversation to ensue.

Cheers!
