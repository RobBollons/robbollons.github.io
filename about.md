My name is Rob Bollons, I'm an experienced developer of 8 years with an ongoing passion for tech, currently working as a Technical Lead. I've worked on many successful projects, some of which include; automated server management facilities, Intranet accounting systems, corporate websites, e-commerce websites and enterprise SaaS data-driven systems.
I strive to be technology agnostic but my main areas of interest are Functional JavaScript Programming, Info Security, automation and UNIX tooling.
I enjoy going to developer community meet-ups and have given numerous talks on a range of development related subjects.
